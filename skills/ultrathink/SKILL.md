# Ultrathink

Sole public Grok App command. Same XML contract as `swcstudiospace/plugin` Prompt Uplift plus Graph of Thought, encoded as one agent-executable skill.

It is a skill, not a harness, and not a router. Grok Super Heavy loads this document. OMP `omp plugin link` remains the turn-rewriting runtime inside omp. Do not fetch GitHub at runtime.

`prompt-uplift` and `graph-of-thought` are retired libraries. Do not invoke them. Do not shell out to them. This skill vendors their contracts and runs Stages 0-4 itself.

Public slash token is `/ultrathink` only. Incoming prefixes `uplift` and `think` are absorbed in Stage 0, not extra picker commands.

## Operability

1. Grok App — invoke `/ultrathink`. That is the only public slash command.
2. Grok Bot / Hermes — SWC skills stay available by name. They are not App picker commands.
3. Coding in OMP — keep `omp plugin link`. The plugin already rewrites the turn. Do not double-uplift.
4. GitHub is the source of truth. Load local copies pinned by `references/SOURCE.lock` when present.

## Stage 0 — absorb or skip

Strip an absorbed invoke prefix, then continue. Match case-insensitively at the start of the text:

- `/ultrathink`
- `/uplift`
- `/think`
- `ultrathink:`
- `uplift:`
- `think:`

After a strip, if the remainder is empty, apply the pipeline to the current user task body. If there is no task body, ask for the task. Do not no-op.

Skip Stages 1-3 when any of these hold **after** prefix strip:

- Text still starts with `/` (any other slash command)
- Text starts with `raw:`
- Text is trivial (`yes`, `ok`, `lgtm`, `thanks`, `continue`, `go ahead`)
- Text already starts with `BUILD_PROMPT`, `FIX_PROMPT`, `RESEARCH_PROMPT`, `CHANGE_PROMPT`, or `UPLIFTED_PROMPT`
- `PI_ULTRATHINK_CHILD=1` or `PI_AIO_CHILD=1`
- This turn is already an ultrathink node fill
- Input already contains a `GRAPH_OF_THOUGHT` block

`uplift:` after strip forces Stage 1 only when the remaining skip rules do not apply.

## Stage 1 — Prompt Uplift

Load `references/uplift-prompt.md`. Return only XML.

Pick exactly one root:

| Root | Use when |
|---|---|
| BUILD_PROMPT | New feature, page, flow, or capability |
| FIX_PROMPT | Bug, regression, broken behavior |
| RESEARCH_PROMPT | Investigate, explain, compare, explore |
| CHANGE_PROMPT | Refactor, rename, migrate, restyle, adjust existing behavior |
| UPLIFTED_PROMPT | None of the above fits cleanly, or fallback wrap |

Required children: `ORIGINAL` (verbatim user task after prefix strip), `SYSTEM_ROLE`, `CONTEXT` or `APP_CONTEXT`, `SCOPE`, `CONSTRAINTS`, `ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA`, `OUT_OF_SCOPE`.

Never emit `ultrathink` as the output root. That tag is an inbound skip signal in plugin `detect.ts`. Emitting it creates a skip-loop the next time OMP sees the payload.

If rewrite fails, is empty, has no allowed root, or exceeds 20000 characters, use the fallback wrap in `references/uplift-prompt.md`. Audit marker `source: fallback`.

## Stage 2 — Graph of Thought

Load `references/got-prompt.md` and `references/node-kinds.md`. Return only JSON.

- 3 to 8 nodes. Target 4 to 8.
- First node kind `understand`, empty `depends_on`.
- Last node kind `synthesize`.
- Closed kinds: `understand`, `decompose`, `generate`, `compare`, `critique`, `aggregate`, `refine`, `synthesize`.
- No cycles. No tool calls. Questions specific to this task.
- Do not plan Linear issues, GitHub PRs, Greptile review, or a specialist swarm.

If the planner fails or yields fewer than 3 valid nodes, use FALLBACK_GRAPH and mark `source: fallback`.

## Stage 3 — Chain of Thought

Load `references/cot-prompt.md`. Topologically sort, then fill one node at a time. Return only node XML with `thinking` and `conclusion`. Later nodes use predecessor conclusions. On fill failure, set both fields to the node question.

## Stage 4 — inject and execute

Inject `<GRAPH_OF_THOUGHT>` into the uplifted spec just before the root close tag. If a block already exists, replace it. Then execute. Do not reprint the XML or the graph unless Ove asks to audit. Prefer repository evidence over this plan if they disagree. Do not create GitHub or Linear issues.

## Stage 4.5 — Mermaid (optional)

Output-only. Default off unless Ove asked to see the graph. Not a planner call. Must not trigger another GoT.

Sanitize every title and kind before rendering: keep `[A-Za-z0-9 _-]`, replace everything else with space, truncate to 48 chars. No remote Mermaid renderer.

## Super Heavy

Nodes are work items, not extra models. Fan-out depth 1. Node owners MUST NOT invoke ultrathink.

## Fail-open

If uplift or think fails, pass the original prompt through and emit one audit line (`root`, `source: fallback`). Never block the user. Never pretend fallback was model-produced.

## Verification

- Output starts with `<` and ends with `>` when Stages 1-4 ran.
- Exactly one allowed root. No `ultrathink` output root.
- Node count 3 to 8. First understand. Last synthesize. No cycles.
- Every filled node has THINKING and CONCLUSION.
- No secrets. No runtime fetch. No invented repo facts.
- No second skill was invoked for uplift or the graph.
